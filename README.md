# BMAC: ~~Beautiful Macros~~ Big Mac

A macro (as in Excel macro, not C or Lisp macro) recorder, with conditional buns and recursive patties.

## Inspiration from ~~culinary~~ computer science:
- On computable numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem (Turing, 1937) [[paper]](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf)
  > Computing is normally done by writing certain symbols on paper. We may suppose this paper is divided into squares like a child's arithmetic book.
  > In elementary arithmetic the two-dimensional character of the paper is sometimes used.
  > But such a use is always avoidable, and I think that it will be agreed that the two-dimensional character of paper is no essential of computation.
  > I assume then that the computation is carried out on one-dimensional paper, i.e. on a tape divided into squares.
    
  Turing's idea, although mathematically elegant, complicates the pedagogy of computing, because a 2D grid possesses topological and geometric structures that a 1D tape lacks -- structures central to our visual-spatial intuition. This project returns to Turing's original intuition by restoring the "child's arithmetic book" and the "two-dimensional character of paper," which, though "no essential of computation," is crucial for beginners who have not yet developed computational intuition.
