# BMAC: ~~Beautiful Macros~~ Big Mac

A macro (as in Excel macro, not C or Lisp macro) recorder, with conditional buns and recursive patties.

Turing's idea, although mathematically elegant, complicates the pedagogy of computing, because a 2D grid possesses topological and geometric structures that a 1D tape lacks -- structures central to our visual-spatial intuition. This project returns to Turing's original intuition by restoring the "child's arithmetic book" and the "two-dimensional character of paper," which, though "no essential of computation," is crucial for beginners who have not yet developed computational intuition.
