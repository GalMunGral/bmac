## Babushka Macros: Recursive Programming by Demonstration on a 2D Grid

## Abstract 
> Computing is normally done by writing certain symbols on paper. We may suppose this paper is divided into squares like a child's arithmetic book.
> In elementary arithmetic the two-dimensional character of the paper is sometimes used.
> But such a use is always avoidable, and I think that it will be agreed that the two-dimensional character of paper is no essential of computation.
> I assume then that the computation is carried out on one-dimensional paper, i.e. on a tape divided into squares.

The idea of a 1D memory model, though mathematically clean, strips away the topological and geometric structures of a 2D grid that are central to our visual-spatial intuition, thereby complicating the pedagogy of computing. This project seeks to return to Turing's original inspiration by reimagining the "child's arithmetic book" and restoring the "two-dimensional character of paper," which, though "no essential of computation," is crucial for beginners who have not yet developed an intuition for computational processes.

The grid is powered by a recursive macro recorder, allowing recorded actions to nest within other recordings, including themselves. It offers an embodied introduction to computing through visual programming by demonstration (PbD), in the style of Pygmalion. It uses only direct recording and playback of drag-and-drop actions, without inference or generalization, keeping both data flow and control flow experiential through the spatial and temporal unfolding of the playback animation, rather than symbolic representations which only acquire meaning through active interpretation.
