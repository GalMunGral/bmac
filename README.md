# Babushka Macros

A recursive macro recorder (as in Excel macro, not C or Lisp macro) on a 2D grid for introducing computing through programming by demonstration (PbD). Uses only drag-and-drop interactions with zero inference and zero generalization.

## Abstract 
> Computing is normally done by writing certain symbols on paper. We may suppose this paper is divided into squares like a child's arithmetic book.
> In elementary arithmetic the two-dimensional character of the paper is sometimes used.
> But such a use is always avoidable, and I think that it will be agreed that the two-dimensional character of paper is no essential of computation.
> I assume then that the computation is carried out on one-dimensional paper, i.e. on a tape divided into squares.

Turing's idea, although mathematically elegant, complicates the pedagogy of computing, because a 2D grid possesses topological and geometric structures that a 1D tape lacks -- structures central to our visual-spatial intuition. This project returns to Turing's original intuition by restoring the "child's arithmetic book" and the "two-dimensional character of paper," which, though "no essential of computation," are crucial for beginners who have not yet developed computational intuition.
